zip(*rows): 
zip converts list of row to list of column
Ex:	l = [['Shishir','10'],['Rahul','20']]
	print(zip(*l))                               #  It prints [('Shishir', 'Rahul'), ('10,'20')]

'*' in zip(*rows):
Is an unpacking operator
It unpacks each inner list(row) to pass it as an argument to zip()
Ex:	zip(l) takes l as one argument
	zip(*l) takes each inner list of l as one argument

line 22:

userID = 'U' + str(int(users[-1][2].strip()[1::])+1).zfill(3) :
users is a list of list
users[-1] will extract the last user details
users[-1][2] will extract the last userID

why indexing from 1 ( users[-1][2].strip()[1::] )??
userID is in the form of "Uxxx" where xxx are numbers
Ex: 	u1 = "U001"
	u = u1[1::] 	# u = "001"
					# To increment convert to int add 1 convert to string.
	U =int(u1)	# U = 1
	U += 1		# U = 2
	u = str(U)	# u = "2"	But we need "002"

zfill(3):
It adds 0 on the left until it reaches the given width
Ex:	a = "19"
	b = a.zfill(3)	# b = "019"
	b = a.zfill(4)	# b = "0019"

In the previous example,
We need "002" but after converting to string it is "2"
So we do 
	var = u.zfill(3)	#var = "002"
